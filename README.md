Welcome to Science with Empathy, a comprehensive resource for researchers committed to the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Reuse) in animal research! This repository provides a central hub for information and tools for ethical animal research. It is categorized based on the 3Rs, making it easy to find the resources you need:

* **Replacement:** Explore alternative research methods that bypass animals altogether, like in-silico modeling or cell cultures.
* **Reduction:** Learn best practices for optimizing experimental design to achieve reliable results with fewer animals. Discover resources on sample size calculation and efficient statistical analysis.
* **Reuse:** Find information on best practices for animal housing, husbandry, pain management, and refinement of procedures to minimize animal suffering.

**Contributing to Science with Empathy:**

We believe in fostering a collaborative community for advancing ethical animal research.  We welcome contributions from researchers of all backgrounds!  See the CONTRIBUTING.md: CONTRIBUTING.md file for details on how to submit resources.

Let's work together to ensure scientific progress happens alongside animal well-being!
